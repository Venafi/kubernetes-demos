# Kubernetes Demos

This repository contains demos that show how to secure Kubernetes workloads with **CyberArk Certificate Manager**

> ⚠️ These are demos for learning. They are simplified and not production-ready.

---

## Assumptions
- You have access to CyberArk Certificate Manager and have the entitlements to use **Workload Identity Manager** and **Kubernetes add-on**
- If you do not, sign up for an account at https://ui.venafi.cloud . 

## Comprehensive Use Cases

The [`main/`](main) directory contains **full, end-to-end scenarios**, such as:
- SaaS quick path
- Certificate Discovery
- Istio service mesh with mTLS and cert issuance
- Workload Identity Manager for SPIFFE compliant certs with enterprise PKI for service mesh
- Cyberark CLI based mechanism (`venctl`) to install and manage Kubernetes components 
- Redhat Operator based mechanism (as an alternate path to `venctl`) to manage Kubernetes components in OpenShift 

Refer to the [README](main/README.md) to get started with configurations in the SaaS and runtime instructions provided [here](main/CLOUD-DEMO.md)

If you prefer to use a ready-to-use EC2 machine with a cluster along with all the dependencies, just reach out.
