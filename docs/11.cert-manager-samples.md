## Securing an Ingress using jetstack-secure in Kubernetes
In this use case we will use Venafi TPP to issue signed certificates. We will be using openshift as the kubernetes platform. We will also be creating namesapace scoped issuers that connect to the TPP server to provision the certificates. We will then deploy a sample application , create certificates resources referenceing the issuers. We will also be creating Ingress resources to secure the applications utilizing certs generated from TPP.


In this eample we will create the following
    - An nginx application
    - An issuer
    - A CertificateRequestPolicy that will allow CertificateRequest to be automatically approved or denied based on the defined rules.
    - RBAC
    - We will create an ingress that exposes HTTPS routes from outside the cluster to services within the cluster. Traffic routing is controlled by rules defined on the Ingress resource.

```
make init
```
- Create a sample app
```
install-sample-app
```
- Create a venafi issuer

```
make create-venafi-issuer

```
Check the status of the venafi issuer , the issuer should show the ready state as true

```
kubectl get issuer -n sample-apps
NAME                        READY   AGE
sandbox-venafi-tpp-issuer   True    66s
```

- Create a Certificate Request Policy
A CertificateRequestPolicy is a cluster wide resource and in addition to providing the ability to define local policies can also inherit policies from Venafi and rego via plugins. The plugins are automatically installed and enabled with the Venafi Jetstack Enterprise policy approver.

```
make create-sample-apps-policy
```
- Create a Certificate
```
make create-certificate-for-ingress
```
check the status of the certificate request. The certificate should be approved and the Status should be ready

```
kubectl get cr -n sample-apps
NAME                                           APPROVED   DENIED   READY   ISSUER              REQUESTOR                                            AGE
coffee.riaz-mohamed-gcp.jetstacker.net-fnhxx   True                True    venafi-tpp-issuer   system:serviceaccount:jetstack-secure:cert-manager   9s
```

check the certificate

```
kubectl get certificate -n sample-apps
NAME                                     READY   SECRET                                   AGE
coffee.riaz-mohamed-gcp.jetstacker.net   True    coffee.riaz-mohamed-gcp.jetstacker.net   79s
```

- Create an ingress resource

```
make create-ingress-resource 
```
Check ingress address

```
kubectl get ingress -n sample-apps
NAME                        CLASS   HOSTS                                    ADDRESS       PORTS     AGE
venafi-tpp-ingress-coffee   nginx   coffee.riaz-mohamed-gcp.jetstacker.net   34.28.54.87   80, 443   54s
```
Update DNS and test

## Securing an Ingress and Routes using jetstack-secure in Openshift

In this eample we will create the following
    - An nginx application
    - An issuer
    - A CertificateRequestPolicy that will allow CertificateRequest to be automatically approved or denied based on the defined rules.
    - RBAC
    - We will create an ingress that exposes HTTPS routes from outside the cluster to services within the cluster. Traffic routing is controlled by rules defined on the Ingress resource.

```
make init
```
- Create a sample app
```
install-sample-app
```
- Create a venafi issuer

```
make create-venafi-issuer

```
Check the status of the venafi issuer , the issuer should show the ready state as true

```
kubectl get issuer -n sample-apps
NAME                        READY   AGE
venafi-tpp-issuer   True    66s
```

- Create a Certificate Request Policy
A CertificateRequestPolicy is a cluster wide resource and in addition to providing the ability to define local policies can also inherit policies from Venafi and rego via plugins. The plugins are automatically installed and enabled with the Venafi Jetstack Enterprise policy approver.

```
make create-sample-apps-policy
```
- Create a Certificate
```
make create-certificate-for-ingress
```
check the status of the certificate request. The certificate should be approved and the Status should be ready

```
kubectl get cr -n sample-apps
NAME                                           APPROVED   DENIED   READY   ISSUER              REQUESTOR                                            AGE
coffee.riaz-mohamed-gcp.jetstacker.net-fnhxx   True                True    venafi-tpp-issuer   system:serviceaccount:jetstack-secure:cert-manager   9s
```

check the certificate

```
kubectl get certificate -n sample-apps
NAME                                     READY   SECRET                                   AGE
coffee.riaz-mohamed-gcp.jetstacker.net   True    coffee.riaz-mohamed-gcp.jetstacker.net   79s
```
### Securing an Ingress
- Create an ingress resource

```
make create-ingress-resource 
```
Check ingress address

```
oc get ingress -n sample-apps
NAME                                CLASS    HOSTS                                    ADDRESS                                                     PORTS     AGE
venafi-tpp-demo-os-ingress-coffee   <none>   coffee.riaz-mohamed-gcp.jetstacker.net   router-default.apps.ocp-test-cm.36jt.p1.openshiftapps.com   80, 443   86m
```
### Generating Java Keystore and Securing a Java Application Using Cert-Manager

- Install the cert-manager-openshift-route project
```
make install-cert-manager-openshift-route
```

- Create a Certificate Request Policy
A CertificateRequestPolicy is a cluster wide resource and in addition to providing the ability to define local policies can also inherit policies from Venafi and rego via plugins. The plugins are automatically installed and enabled with the Venafi Jetstack Enterprise policy approver.

```
make create-openshift-route-policy
```
- Create an Route

```
make create-openshift-route-resource 
```

## Securing Openshift Routes using Routes Definitions
In this use case we will use Venafi TPP to issue signed certificates. We will be using openshift as the kubernetes platform. We will also be creating both namesapace scoped issuers as well as cluster scoped issuers that connect to the TPP server to provision the certificates. We will then deploy a sample application , create certificates resources referenceing the issuers. We will also be creating Route resources to secure the applications utilizing certs generated from TPP.

```
make init
```

- Create a venafi issuer

```
make create-venafi-issuer-truststore

```
Check the status of the venafi issuer , the issuer should show the ready state as true

```
kubectl get issuer -n sample-apps 
NAME                           READY   AGE
venafi-tpp-issuer              True    154m
venafi-tpp-issuer-truststore   True    81s
```

- Create a password for the keystore

```
make create-truststore-password

```

- Create a Certificate Request Policy
A CertificateRequestPolicy is a cluster wide resource and in addition to providing the ability to define local policies can also inherit policies from Venafi and rego via plugins. The plugins are automatically installed and enabled with the Venafi Jetstack Enterprise policy approver.

```
make create-trustsore-policy
```

- Create a certificate from the ca-issuer for the app . NOTE: under usages -server auth This will create the keystore to be used by the java app

```
make create-server-certificate

```
check the status of the certificate request. The certificate should be approved and the Status should be ready

```
kubectl get cr -n sample-apps
NAME                                           APPROVED   DENIED   READY   ISSUER                         REQUESTOR                                            AGE
coffee.riaz-mohamed-gcp.jetstacker.net-fnhxx   True                True    venafi-tpp-issuer              system:serviceaccount:jetstack-secure:cert-manager   169m
java-server-app-cert-fthht                     True                True    venafi-tpp-issuer-truststore   system:serviceaccount:jetstack-secure:cert-manager   7s
```

Check the secret created by the certificate resource (Should contain the truststore.jks, truststore.12, keystore.jks, keystore.p12, tls.crt, tls.key, ca.crt )


```
kubectl describe secret java-server-truststore -n sample-apps
Name:         java-server-truststore
Namespace:    sample-apps
Labels:       <none>
Annotations:  cert-manager.io/alt-names: 
              cert-manager.io/certificate-name: java-server-app-cert
              cert-manager.io/common-name: javaserver.svc.cluster.local
              cert-manager.io/ip-sans: 
              cert-manager.io/issuer-group: cert-manager.io
              cert-manager.io/issuer-kind: Issuer
              cert-manager.io/issuer-name: venafi-tpp-issuer-truststore
              cert-manager.io/uri-sans: 

Type:  kubernetes.io/tls

Data
====
truststore.p12:  1426 bytes
ca.crt:          1281 bytes
keystore.jks:    3666 bytes
keystore.p12:    3927 bytes
tls.crt:         1923 bytes
tls.key:         1679 bytes
truststore.jks:  963 bytes
```

- Deploy a springboot app

```
make deploy-app-for-truststores

```

### Test TLS

To test TLS we will require a client cert and key. For testing purposes we will generate the cert and key from the same issuer. Note usages: - client auth in the yaml

```
make create-client-certificate

```

This will result in an error.

Get the client crts and keys

```
make test-trust-app
```

Test the app. Update DNS to point to myapp in this example.

```
curl https://<Load balancer IP>/trust --cert tls.crt --key tls.key --cacert ca.crt -k
```
