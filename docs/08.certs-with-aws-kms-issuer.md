# cert-manager AWS KMS issuer to manage certificates in cluster. 
Use AWS KMS to create a customer managed KMS key with a CA that will be used for signing all certificate requests


## Installing the cert-manager AWS KMS issuer

**IMPORTANT NOTE**
> Before installing cert-manager AWS KMS issuer, review the Helm chart located [here](../external-issuers/kms/templates/values.yaml). 
Several environment variables are used to setup the KMS issuer that is configured in `settings.sh`. More specifically the JS_AWS* variables that hold the region , key and the secret to AWS. 
AWS KMS issuer is regarded as an external issuer. More information about external issuers can be found [here](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/external/)


From the top level directory run the following 
```
make install-kms-issuer-in-cluster
```
This will install `kms-issuer` that request certificates signed using an AWS KMS asymmetric key. 


Run the following to validate that the addtional module is installed.
```
kubectl get pods -n jetstack-secure
```
The `kms-issuer-5bf794447b-zcfsd` release should be installed and it's the state should be `Ready=1/1`

## Creating a AWS KMS key.

Change to the `external-issuers` directory
```
cd external-issuers
```

Review the KMSKey resource located [here](../external-issuers/kms/config/kmskey.yaml)
The configuration is pretty straight forward and creates a new KMS key in the specified region using the credentials provided in the Helm chart. 

Run
 ```
 make create-kmskey
 ```

Validate that the `KMSKey` is created
```
kubectl describe KMSKey jetstack-secure-kms-key
```
and you will should see the following indicating that the issuer is ready and good to go.

```
Status:
  Conditions:
    Last Transition Time:  2022-09-20T20:31:42Z
    Reason:                Issued
    Status:                True
    Type:                  Ready
  Key Id:                  1f612a70-2fgb-4bd5-69ce-7a14ff41e155
Events:
  Type    Reason  Age                From               Message
  ----    ------  ----               ----               -------
  Normal  Issued  37m (x3 over 37m)  kmskey_controller  

 ```

## Creating a KMS Issuer

Review the [KMS Issuer](../external-issuers/kms/config/kms-issuer.yaml) 

The KMS issuer references the KMS key and creates a signing certificate in KMS where the private key will be held. 

Run
```
make create-kms-issuer
```

This will create a `KMSIssuer` in the `sandbox` namespace.  The configuration currently is setup to generate a CA certificate for 1 year. 

Run the following to describe the KMS Issuer and it's status
```
kubectl describe KMSIssuer -n sandbox
```

You will see the following. 

```
  Conditions:
    Last Transition Time:  2022-09-20T20:31:52Z
    Reason:                Issued
    Status:                True
    Type:                  Ready
Events:
  Type    Reason  Age                From                  Message
  ----    ------  ----               ----                  -------
  Normal  Issued  44m (x2 over 44m)  kmsissuer_controller  
```

## Validating the Certificate generated in KMS

One of the things you will notice when you describe the issuer is that the issuer has a `Certificate` field that carries the CA certificate resource. 

Run the following to check the certificate information.
```
make validate-kms-issuer-ca
```
and you will see the CA certificate info as below

```
Certificate:
    Data:
        Version: 3 (0x2)
        Serial Number:
            87:0b:19:0b:21:1c:a8:9f:42:87:e3:be:42:f2:37:f1:55:19:g7:12
    Signature Algorithm: sha256WithRSAEncryption
        Issuer: CN=Jetstack Secure Demo Root CA
        Validity
            Not Before: Aug 29 00:00:00 2022 GMT
            Not After : Aug 29 00:00:00 2023 GMT
        Subject: CN=Jetstack Secure Demo Root CA
```

## Creating policy and RBAC for approving the certificate requests

Review the following files 
- [Certificate Policy RBAC](../external-issuers/kms/config/cert-policy-rbac.yaml)
- [Certificate Policy](../external-issuers/kms/config/cert-policy.yaml)

Notice the `selector` in the policy. Specifically the `kind` and `group`. It is set to match the KMS issuer `group` and `kind`. Addtionally the policy approver has been updated to include KMS signer [here](../certificate-approver/approver-policy/values.yaml) The approver policy has to be reinstalled to include the addtional signer.   

Run the following to create the policy and RBAC
```
make create-policy-and-rbac
```

## Creating certs for validation

Simply run the following 
```
make create-certs
```

This will create two `Certificate` resources in the `sandbox` namespace. Run the following

```
kubectl get Certificate -n sandbox
```
And you will see the following 

```
NAME                                 READY   SECRET                               AGE
cert1-kms-issuer.svc.cluster.local   True    cert1-kms-issuer.svc.cluster.local   3m
cert2-kms-issuer.svc.cluster.local   False   cert2-kms-issuer.svc.cluster.local   3m
```

Look at the accompanying `CertificateRequests` by running 

```
kubectl get CertificateRequests -n sandbox
```
You will see the following 

```
NAME                                       APPROVED   DENIED   READY   ISSUER       REQUESTOR                                            AGE
cert1-kms-issuer.svc.cluster.local-lrn5p   True                True    kms-issuer   system:serviceaccount:jetstack-secure:cert-manager   3m
cert2-kms-issuer.svc.cluster.local-jzxkk              True     False   kms-issuer   system:serviceaccount:jetstack-secure:cert-manager   3m
```

One of them will be `Approved` and the other `Denied`. Review the `Certificate` resource and the associated policy to understand why one of them was `Denied`

Describe the `CertificateRequest` that was `Denied` and you will see 
```
Events:
  Type     Reason  Age   From                            Message
  ----     ------  ----  ----                            -------
  Warning  Denied  40m   policy.cert-manager.io          No policy approved this request: [kms-issuer-policy-for-ns-sandbox: spec.allowed.uris.required: Required value: true]
  Warning  Denied  40m   certificaterequests-controller  The CertificateRequest was denied by an approval controller

```
