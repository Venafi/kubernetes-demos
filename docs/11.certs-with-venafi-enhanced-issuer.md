**IMPORTANT NOTE**
> Before installing cert-manager Venafi Enhanced Issuer, review the Helm chart located [here](../venafi-enhanced-issuer/templates/values.yaml). 
More information about Venafi Enhanced Issuer can be found [here](https://platform.jetstack.io/documentation/installation/venafi-enhanced-issuer)


Change directory to `venafi-enhanced-issuer`

```
cd venafi-enhanced-issuer
```
To setup the enviroment, run
```
make init
```

## Creating a Venafi Enhanced Issuer using credentials stored in a secret. 

There are several mechanisms to configure the venafi enhanced issuer. In this section we will go through creating a VenafiIssuer with an access token stored in a secret as well as create a VenafiClusterIssuer with username and password for the TPP API user stored in a secret.

- Create a VenafiClusterIssuer 
    This step will create a Roles and Role Bindings that will allow the venafi connection to read the secrets that will be created to store the Venafi TPP the username and password for Venafi.
    Creates a Secret that stores the username, password and access token
    Creates a VenafiConnection that uses username and password as the auth method
    Creates a VenafiClusterIssuer

```
make create-venafi-cluster-issuer
```
To check if the cluster issuer is in a READY State

```
kubectl get venaficlusterissuer
NAME                       READY   REASON    MESSAGE   LASTTRANSITION   OBSERVEDGENERATION   GENERATION   AGE
vtpp-cluster-issuer        True    Checked   checked   139m             1                    1            139m
```

- Create a VenafiIssuer 
    This step will create a Roles and Role Bindings that will allow the venafi connection to read the secrets that will be created to store the Venafi TPP the username and password for Venafi.
    Creates a Secret that stores the username, password and access token
    Creates a VenafiConnection that uses the access as the auth method
    Creates a VenafiIssuer

```
make create-venafi-issuer
```
- To check if the cluster issuer is in a READY State

```
kubectl get VenafiIssuer -n sandbox                         
NAME                  READY   REASON    MESSAGE   LASTTRANSITION   OBSERVEDGENERATION   GENERATION   AGE
vtpp-sandbox-issuer   True    Checked   checked   5s               1                    1            6m34s
```

- Create certificate policies

```
make create-cert-policy                 
```
- Create sample certs

```
make create-sample-certs              
```

## Creating a Venafi Enhanced Issuer using credentials stored in a vault.

In this example Hashicorp Vault is configured to use Kubernetes authentication, and it is running inside the Kubernetes cluster. Alternatively you can configure Hashicorp Vault to use JWT authentication, which is similar but with some important differences. The disadvantage is that with JWT authentication Hashicorp Vault will not be able to check for revoked Kubernetes JWT tokens. The advantage is that Vault won't need to connect to the Kubernetes API server which makes it easier to connect to a Hashicorp Vault server that is running outside the Kubernetes cluster where venafi-enhanced-issuer is running.

If a vault server is not avaialble , it can be installed in cluster. 
- Install vault in the kubernetes cluster
From the root directory run 
```
make install-vault-in-cluster 

```

- Configure Hashicorp Vault for "Kubernetes" authentication, and create Role which will allow the application-team-1 ServiceAccount to authenticate and impersonate it.

```
make configure-vault
```

- Store the Venafi TPP credentials in a secret in Hashicorp Vault and create an access policy to allow these to be read by the Role that was created in the previous step.

```
make configure-vault-policy

```
```
make mount-tpp-secret

```
- Create a ServiceAccount which venafi-enhanced-issuer will use to authenticate to Hashicorp Vault.

```
make create-service-account-for-vault
```

- Create RBAC for Venafi Connection 
```
make create-rbac-for-vault-connection
```
- Create a Veanfi Connection

```
make create-vtpp-venafi-connection-with-vault
```
Check if the connection is created

```
kubectl get venaficonnection -A | grep application

jetstack-secure   application-team-1        52s
sandbox           application-team-2        52s
```

- Create VenafiIssuer and VenafiClusterIssuer

```
make create-vtpp-venafi-issuer-with-vault
```

Check if the Issuers are in the READY State 

```
 kubectl get venaficlusterissuer -A | grep application
application-team-1         True    Checked   checked   69s              1                    1            70s
```

- Create a CertificateRequest policy along with the Role and Rolebindings refrencing the VenafiClusterIssuer and the VenafiIssuer

```
make create-cert-policy-vault
```

- Create a Sample certificates using both the VenafiClusterIssuer and the VenafiIssuer

```
make create-sample-certs-vault
```
 Check if the certificates have been provisioned

 ```
kubectl get certificate -n sandbox || grep app
sample-vault.app1.riaz-mohamed-gcp.jetstacker.net        True    sample-vault.app1.riaz-mohamed-gcp.jetstacker.net           5m35s
sample-vault.app2.riaz-mohamed-gcp.jetstacker.net        True    sample-vault.vei.riaz-mohamed-gcp.jetstacker.net            5m35s
```
