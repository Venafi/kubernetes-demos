# Create policies for auto approval

In this use case we will create `CertificateRequestPolicy` resources that will allow `CertificateRequest` to be automatically approved or denied based on the defined rules

The `cert-manager-approver-policy` component is already installed and running in the cluster. A `CertificateRequestPolicy` is a cluster wide resource and in addition to providing the ability to define local policies can also inherit policies from Venafi and rego via plugins. The plugins are automatically installed and enabled with the Venafi Jetstack Enterprise policy approver. 

- Change to the `certificate-approver` directory from the top level
```
cd certificate-approver
```  
- Run initialize to create the temporary folders
```
make init
```
- Review the files `certificate-approver/templates/cert-policy.yaml` and `certificate-approver/templates/cert-policy-rbac.yaml`
There are several environment variables referenced here. The values themselves are set in `settings.sh`. Make sure that your Venafi Trust Protection Platform settings are correctly set. 
- Create the policy and the required RBAC. The Jetstack certificate approver will apply the policy based on what is configured in the `CertificateRequestPolicy`. You will notice that the policy will be specifically applied to what is defined in the `selector`
- When you believe you have all the right values set in `settings.sh` run the following to create the following
  - A `ConfigMap` that holds the CA that allows connection to Venafi 
  - A `Secret` that holds the *access_token* to authenticate against Venafi 
  - A `CertificateRequestPolicy` that has the policy to either `Approve` or `Deny` a `CertificateRequest`
  - A `ClusterRole` and `ClusterRoleBinding` that allows the `CertificateRequest` requestor to use the policy
 ```
 make create-venafi-tpp-certificate-policy
 ```   
You will see the following output. Review them.
 ```
configmap/venafi-tpp-ca-bundle created
secret/access-token created
certificaterequestpolicy.policy.cert-manager.io/cert-policy-for-apps-in-sandbox created
clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/cert-manager-policy:cert-policy-for-apps-in-sandbox created
clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/cert-manager-policy:cert-policy-for-apps-in-sandbox created
 ```
- Make sure that the `CertificateRequestPolicy` has Ready=True
- Run the following 
```
kubectl get crp
```
At this time you will see only one `CertificateRequestPolicy` called `cert-policy-for-apps-in-sandbox`
- Describe the `CertificateRequestPolicy` resource by running
```
kubectl describe CertificateRequestPolicy cert-policy-for-apps-in-sandbox
```
You will see the following in the Events section among other things
```
Events:
  Type    Reason  Age                From                    Message
  ----    ------  ----               ----                    -------
  Normal  Ready   5s (x5 over 3m6s)  policy.cert-manager.io  CertificateRequestPolicy is ready for approval evaluation
```
This means that there is a `CertificateRequestPolicy` in place for an issuer called `sandbox-venafi-tpp-issuer` that will validate all `CertificateRequests`. The `ClusterRoleBindings` in production can be changed to `RoleBindings` and tied to specific user for more granular control. 
- At this time there is only one `selfsigned-issuer` that we created to test certificate issuance. We need to create another issuer called `sandbox-venafi-tpp-issuer` that uses Venafi to fulfil certificate requests. 
- Review `certificate-approver/templates/venafi-issuer.yaml` and make sure the referenced environment variables have their values correctly set in `settings.sh`
- To create the issuer in the `sandbox` namespace, run the following
```
make create-venafi-issuer
```
- Confirm that the issuer has been created and it is Ready=True
 ```
 kubectl -n sandbox get Issuer
 ```
 You will see the following output. 
```
NAME                        READY   AGE
sandbox-venafi-tpp-issuer   True    10s
selfsigned-issuer           True    13m
```
- Before we create certificates, review the certificate resources `sample-cert` `1,2,3` in `certificate-approver/templates/` directory. The Venafi policy folder must have the ability to issue certificates for the domain referenced in the `Certificate` resource.
