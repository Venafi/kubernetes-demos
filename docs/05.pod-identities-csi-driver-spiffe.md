# Securing pods with identities using the Venafi Jetstack cert-manager CSI Driver SPIFFE


## Installing the Venafi Jetstack cert-manager CSI Driver SPIFFE

**IMPORTANT NOTE - BEGIN**
Before installing cert-manager CSI SPIFFE driver, review the Helm chart located [here](../cert-manager-csi-spiffe/templates/values.yaml)

Several environment variables are used to setup the SPIFFE driver that is configured in `settings.sh` 
One specific configuration that is not obvious from the chart is the `secretName` mounted as `root-cas`. For more information about this can be found [here](https://cert-manager.io/docs/projects/csi-driver-spiffe/#root-ca-bundle)

Specifically before installing make sure that all the root CA's required are in PEM form and set in `JS_VENAFI_INTERMEDIATE_CA_ROOT_PEM_FILE`. In this demo the PEM file holds the root certificate of the private PKI. A secret called `spiffe-source-ca` will be created before install. The CSI SPIFFE driver will create the `ca.crt` based on what's in this CA bundle in every pod. 
**IMPORTANT NOTE - END**

From the top level directory run the following 
```
make install-cert-manager-csi-driver-spiffe
```
This will install `cert-manager-csi-driver-spiffe` that will deliver SPIFFE SVIDS to pods in the `volumeMounts` defined in the deployment. 

**NOTE** `cert-manager-csi-driver-spiffe` is `DaemonSet` and as such you will see a pod for each `Node` in your cluster. When a `pod` is scheduled by a `Node` the relevant certiicate material is injected into the pod's epheremal file system.

Run the following to validate that the addtional module is installed.
```
kubectl get pods -n jetstack-secure
```
The `cert-manager-csi-driver-spiffe` release should be installed and it's the state should be `Ready=3/3`

```

```

The above output is from a three node cluster and as such has 3 csi-driver-spiffe `pods`. The number of csi-driver-spiffe pods that you may see can be different. Addtionally a `cert-manager-csi-driver-approver` is automatically installed. This allows `CertificateRequests` that are processed by SPIFFE driver to be automatically approved. You will not create a separate `CertificateRequestPolicy` for SPIFFE SVIDS that will be delivered to pods. 

Validate that the CSIDriver is also avaialble in cluster. Run, 
```
kubectl get CSIDriver
```
All the CSIDrivers in the cluster will get listed along with `spiffe.csi.cert-manager.io`

```

## Creating an issuer for SPIFFE driver

**IMPORTANT NOTE - BEGIN**
The name of the issuer for SPIFFE CSI driver is set in the Helm Chart. The actual value itself is set in the environment (`settings.sh`) as `JS_CERT_MANAGER_CSI_DRIVER_SPIFFE_ISSUER_NAME`. The value currently set is `jetstack-spiffe-ca-issuer`
Additionally the Helm chart also has it set as a `ClusterIssuer`. 
Based on the above information
- We need to create a issuer called `jetstack-spiffe-ca-issuer` 
- This issuer has to be `ClusterIssuer`. 
- The policy approver that is installed as part of CSI Driver will take care of approving certs automatically. However, the issuer must have the ability to comply to some of the requirements as outlined (here)[https://cert-manager.io/docs/projects/csi-driver-spiffe/#approver] 
 
In terms of specific steps to get to a `ClusterIssuer` called `jetstack-spiffe-ca-issuer` we will 
- Create a namespaced Venafi issuer in the `sandbox` namespace that can issue an intermediate certificate. 
- Create the required `CertificateRequestPolicy` along with the `Role` and `RoleBinding` to obtain a `Certificate` with `isCA=true`
- Subsequently create a `ClusterIssuer` that is defined in the Helm chart. 

For more details review the files [Multiple resources are created from these 2 yaml's]
- [Certificate Policy](../cert-manager-csi-spiffe/templates/cert-policy-for-venafi-ica.yaml)
- [Cluster Issuer](../cert-manager-csi-spiffe/templates/csi-spiffe-issuer.yaml)

 **IMPORTANT NOTE - END**
 
Run
 ```
 make create-spiffe-cluster-issuer
 ```

Validate that the `ClusterIssuer` is configured and ready for use. Run 
```
kubectl describe ClusterIssuer jetstack-spiffe-ca-issuer
```
and you will should see the following indicating that the issuer is ready and good to go.

```

## Deploying a Redis server and client app 

Review the following files. 
```
- [Redis Server](../cert-manager-csi-spiffe/templates/redis-server.yaml) 
- [Client App](../cert-manager-csi-spiffe/templates/redis-client.yaml)
```
Notice that the only information provided is the driver information. All the required information to generate a SPIFFE x509 SVID will be derived from where the app is deployed. Every pod will have a SVID of the form `spiffe://<trust-domain>/ns/<namespace>/sa/<serviceAccountName>` . For e.g `spiffe://jetstack-dev/ns/sandbox/sa/spiffe-redis-sa`

We will not be creating any addtional `CertificateRequestPolicies` unlike CSI driver, as the SPIFFE driver comes with an addtional approval controller. 

Run
```
make deploy-redis-app
```
This will deploy a `redis-server` app and a client that will be used to communicate over mTLS. 

Run the following to validate that the pods are running.
```
kubectl get pods -n sandbox
```
Both `spiffe-redis-server-app` and `spiffe-client-app` pods should be `Running` with `Ready=1/1`

```
NAME                                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

spiffe-client-app-6486fd958c-fck8q         1/1     Running   0          7m
spiffe-redis-server-app-867cc6664c-n7nhj   1/1     Running   0          7m
```

Additonally, run 
```
kubectl get CertificateRequests -n sandbox
```
and you will see , among other `CertificateRequests` the following 

```
NAME                                                     APPROVED   DENIED   READY   ISSUER                      REQUESTOR                                                       AGE

8fcf0f88-acbd-4bab-953f-cbb12958cc3f                     True                True    jetstack-spiffe-ca-issuer   system:serviceaccount:sandbox:client-app-sa                     22m
```
**NOTE** The intermediate certificate for `jetstack-spiffe-ca-issuer`, is issued by Venafi and  will be available in the policy folder from where it was issued. Review your Venafi policy folder. Additonally , refresh the Jetstack Secure dashboard and you will see two new certs show up. One for spiffe-redis-server-app and another for spiffe-client-app

### Validating the redis deployment 

Check that both the server and client have certs injected into a pod's volumeMount
```
kubectl -n sandbox exec -it spiffe-redis-server-app-867cc6664c-n7nhj -- ls /redis-server-tls/certs
```
You will see 
```
ca.crt   tls.crt  tls.key
```
Additionally, run 
```
kubectl -n sandbox exec -it spiffe-client-app-6486fd958c-fck8q -- ls /spiffe-client-tls/certs
```
You will see
```
ca.crt   tls.crt  tls.key
```

To test that if the client is able to access the redis server with the certs run the following 

```
kubectl -n sandbox exec -it spiffe-client-app-6486fd958c-fck8q -- redis-cli -h spiffe-redis-server.sandbox.svc.cluster.local -p 6379 --tls --cacert /spiffe-client-tls/certs/ca.crt --cert /spiffe-client-tls/certs/tls.crt --key /spiffe-client-tls/certs/tls.key ping
```
The output displayed will be 
```
PONG
```

**NOTE** The host used for connecting is the `ClusterIP` service DNS.
