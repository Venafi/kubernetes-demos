# Securing pods with identities using the Venafi Jetstack cert-manager CSI Driver

## Installing the Venafi Jetstack cert-manager CSI Driver

From the top level directory run the following 
```
make install-cert-manager-csi-driver
```
This will install `cert-manager-CSI-driver` that will provide the ability to define `volume` attributes that will leverage `cert-manager` issuer to inject certificates into the pod. 

**NOTE** `cert-manager-CSI-driver` is `DaemonSet` and as such you will see a pod for each `Node` in your cluster. When a `pod` is scheduled by a `Node` the relevant certiicate material is injected into the pod's epheremal file system.

Run the following to validate that the addtional module is installed.
```
kubectl get pods -n jetstack-secure
```
The `cert-manager-csi-driver` release should be installed and it's the state should be `Ready=3/3`

```

```

The above output is from a three node cluster and as such has 3 csi-driver `pods`. What you see may be different.

Validate that the CSIDriver is also avaialble in cluster. Run, 
```
kubectl get CSIDriver
```
All the CSIDrivers in the cluster will get listed along with `csi.cert-manager.io`

```

```

## Creating the required policies to fulfil certificate requests initiated by CSI Driver for the first sample application

Change to the directory `cert-manager-csi`
```
cd cert-manager-csi
```
The cert-manager in the cluster does not have it's approver controller enabled. As such, an appropriate policy is required for `CertificateRequests` to be approved before they are injected. If a `CertificateRequest` is `Denied` the pod will fail to start. 

For the first example to validate CSI Driver, run the following to create a `CertificateRequestPolicy` called `allow-self-signed-issuer-in-ns-sandbox` and `allow-self-signed-issuer-for-pods-in-ns-sandbox`. Additionally a `ClusterRole` and `ClusterRoleBinding` allowing specfic requestors to have access to the policies. This is for a sample that will use `self-signed` issuer in the `sandbox` namespace.  
 
```
make create-policy-and-rbac
```

Run the following to validate that the `CertificateRequestPolicies` are created. 

```
kubectl get crp
```
You will see the following. Validate that the state of the policy says `Ready=True`

```
NAME                                              READY   AGE
allow-self-signed-issuer-for-pods-in-ns-sandbox   True    11s
allow-self-signed-issuer-in-ns-sandbox            True    11s
cert-policy-for-apps-in-sandbox                   True    48m
```

In addtion to the two policies we just created, you will also see a policy that we created while validating a different use case. 


## Deploying the first sample application
From the `cert-manager-csi` directory run
```
make create-sample-app
```

In addition to creating a CA issuer, a Certificate a busybox pod is deployed with replica of 5. To review the `Deployment` click [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cert-manager/csi-driver/main/deploy/example/example-app.yaml)

Run
```
kubectl get pods -n sandbox
```
The output you see will look something like this

```
NAME                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
my-csi-app-85c458479c-cj45j   1/1     Running   0          111s
my-csi-app-85c458479c-khvbt   1/1     Running   0          111s
my-csi-app-85c458479c-ljfpc   1/1     Running   0          111s
my-csi-app-85c458479c-mkjbc   1/1     Running   0          111s
my-csi-app-85c458479c-vwmwd   1/1     Running   0          111s
```
Validate that the cert is available in the defined `volumeMount` by simply running the below. Replace the name of the pod with one of the 5 pods in your cluster.

```
kubectl -n sandbox exec -it my-csi-app-64fc5bdc59-cj45j -- ls /tls
```
The output will be 
```
ca.crt   crt.p12  tls.crt  tls.key
```

Addtionally run, 

```
kubectl -n sandbox exec -it my-csi-app-64fc5bdc59-q6xs2 -- cat /tls/tls.crt | openssl x509 -text -noout | grep spiffe
```
and you will see the DNS and the URI associated with the cert
```
DNS:my-csi-app-64fc5bdc59-q6xs2.sandbox.svc.cluster.local, URI:spiffe://cluster.local/ns/sandbox/pod/my-csi-app-64fc5bdc59-q6xs2/b7cb9f9e-e331-49ca-853e-cca0f6d9c28c
```

**NOTE** Refresh the Jetstack Secure dashboard to view the certificates issued for the 5 pods.  As the certs are issued with a self signed issuer, you will also see an issuing certificate called `ca-issuer` with common-name set to `my-csi-app`. 
Review the `ca-issuer` certificate. In addtion to information about the certificate you will also see some of the contextual information about where the certificate is mounted.  

**ANOTHER NOTE** As the cert-sync-to-venafi module is also running in the cluster, the `ca-issuer` will also show up in the folder that is marked for Discovery in your Venafi platform. Review the policy folder to see this new certificate show up there. The cert-sync only syncs certs that are available in the cluster as TLS secrets. Certs injected into pods are not represented as TLS secrets and as such are not discoverable by Venafi. The Jetstack Secure dashboard is the place to review those certs at this time. 

## Deploying a Redis server and client app 
Let's deploy a second app. This time instead of `busybox` let's use a `Redis` server and a client to access the server.

Additionally, instead of using the self signed issuer, we will use the Venafi Trust Protection Platform issuer. This will allow the security team to issue certs that are policy compliant. 

Review the following files
```
- templates/issuer-for-redis-app.yaml [This is the Venafi Issuer]
- templates/redis-certs-policy-and-rbac [This is the policy and RBAC]
- templates/redis-server.yaml [Redis server deployment with CSI driver config]
- templates/redis-client.yaml [Redis client deployment with CSI driver config]
```
Run the following to create an issuer, required policies and deploy the app.

```
make deploy-redis-app
```

First run 
```
kubectl get CertificateRequestPolicy
```
The new policy `cert-policy-for-redis` must have it's `Ready` state as `True`. If it is not then first resolve it. 
If the `pods` are not in `Running` state then review the `CertificateRequest` resource to understand why there's an error. 

Run 
```
kubectl get pods -n sandbox
```
Both `redis-server` and `redis-client` pods should be `Running` with `Ready=1/1`
```
NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
my-csi-app-64fc5bdc59-2hkzc         1/1     Running   0          28m
my-csi-app-64fc5bdc59-cz9c8         1/1     Running   0          28m
my-csi-app-64fc5bdc59-hdms5         1/1     Running   0          28m
my-csi-app-64fc5bdc59-q6xs2         1/1     Running   0          28m
my-csi-app-64fc5bdc59-vdznk         1/1     Running   0          28m
redis-client-app-5b5b4c7857-ggrkt   1/1     Running   0          61s
redis-server-app-7477d79f6b-xbdg9   1/1     Running   0          63s
```

Additonally, run 
```
kubectl get CertificateRequests -n sandbox
```
and you will see , among other `CertificateRequests` the following 

```
NAME                                                     APPROVED   DENIED   READY   ISSUER                      REQUESTOR                                                       AGE
3d2527c1-93c3-4f1f-833e-3d5a0a9dca34                     True                True    vtpp-issuer-for-redis       system:serviceaccount:jetstack-secure:cert-manager-csi-driver   40m
6797b937-96cf-450c-9b2c-bab0e02da5ee                     True                True    vtpp-issuer-for-redis       system:serviceaccount:jetstack-secure:cert-manager-csi-driver   40m
```
**NOTE** As the `Certificates` for redis pods were issued by Venafi, it will be available in the policy folder from where it was issued. Review your Venafi policy folder.

Additonally , refresh the Jetstack Secure dashboard and you will see two new certs show up. One for redis-server and another for redis-client

### Validating the redis deployment 

Check that both the server and client have certs injected into a pod's volumeMount
```
kubectl -n sandbox exec -it redis-server-app-7477d79f6b-xbdg9 -- ls /redis-master-ssl/certs
```
You will see 
```
ca.crt   tls.crt  tls.key
```
Additionally, run 
```
k -n sandbox exec -it redis-client-app-5b5b4c7857-ggrkt -- ls /redis-client-ssl/certs
```
You will see
```
ca.crt   tls.crt  tls.key
```

To test that if the client is able to access the redis server with the certs run the following 

```
kubectl -n sandbox exec -it redis-client-app-5b5b4c7857-ggrkt -- redis-cli -h redis-server.sandbox.svc.cluster.local -p 6379 --tls --cacert /redis-client-ssl/certs/ca.crt --cert /redis-client-ssl/certs/tls.crt --key /redis-cli
ent-ssl/certs/tls.key ping
```
The output displayed will be 
```
PONG
```

**NOTE** The host used for connecting is the `ClusterIP` service DNS. THe client cert used is in the client pod's volumeMount. The privateKey is specific to client. However the `ca.crt` is common for both the server and client.
