[![Venafi Enhanced Issuer](https://img.youtube.com/vi/UTOropif5wk/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTOropif5wk)


**IMPORTANT NOTE**
> Before installing cert-manager Venafi Enhanced Issuer, review the Helm chart located [here](../venafi-enhanced-issuer/pca/templates/values.yaml). 
More information about Venafi Enhanced Issuer can be found [here](https://platform.jetstack.io/documentation/installation/venafi-enhanced-issuer)

Change directory to venafi-enhanced-issuer
```
cd venafi-enhanced-issuer
```
```
make init

make install-jetstack-venafi-enhanced-issuer-module
```
This will install `js-venafi-enhanced-issuer-controller-manager` that request certificates signed using the Venafi Trust Protection Platform. 


Run the following to validate that the addtional module is installed.
```
kubectl get pods -n jetstack-secure

## Creating a Venafi Enhanced Issuer using credentials stored in a secret. 

There are several mechanisms to configure the venafi enhanced issuer. In this section we will go through creating a VenafiIssuer with an access token stored in a secret as
well as create a VenafiClusterIssuer with username and password for the TPP API user stored in a secret.


- Create Roles and Role Bindings that will allow the venafi enhanced issuer service accounts to read the secrets that will be created to store the Venafi TPP access token and the secret that stores the username and password for Venafi.

```
make create-rbac-for-issuers
```

- Create a secret with the access-token and create a VenafiIssuer to reference the access-token in the secret, also create a secret with the username and password for the TPP API user and create a VenafiClusterIssuer that refrences the username and password.

```
make create-vtpp-venafi-issuer-and-secret
```

The issuers should be in a checked and ready state

```
kubectl get VenafiIssuer -n sandbox      
➜  venafi-enhanced-issuer git:(riaz-example-features-3) ✗ kubectl get VenafiIssuer -n sandbox      
NAME                   READY   REASON    MESSAGE   LASTTRANSITION   OBSERVEDGENERATION   GENERATION   AGE
vtpp-enhanced-issuer   True    Checked   checked   4s               1                    1            5s
➜  venafi-enhanced-issuer git:(riaz-example-features-3) ✗ kubectl get VenafiClusterIssuer          
NAME                          READY   REASON    MESSAGE   LASTTRANSITION   OBSERVEDGENERATION   GENERATION   AGE
vtpp-enhanced-clusterissuer   True    Checked   checked   11s              1                    1            12s
```

- Create a CertificateRequest policy along with the Role and Rolebindings refrencing the VenafiClusterIssuer and the VenafiIssuer

```
make create-cert-policy 
```

- Create a Sample certificates using both the VenafiClusterIssuer and the VenafiIssuer

```
make create-sample-certs
```

## Creating a Venafi Enhanced Issuer using credentials stored in a vault.

In this example Hashicorp Vault is configured to use Kubernetes authentication, and it is running inside the Kubernetes cluster. Alternatively you can configure Hashicorp Vault to use JWT authentication, which is similar but with some important differences. The disadvantage is that with JWT authentication Hashicorp Vault will not be able to check for revoked Kubernetes JWT tokens. The advantage is that Vault won't need to connect to the Kubernetes API server which makes it easier to connect to a Hashicorp Vault server that is running outside the Kubernetes cluster where venafi-enhanced-issuer is running.


- Install vault in the kubernetes cluster


```
make install-hashicorp-vault
```

- Configure Hashicorp Vault for "Kubernetes" authentication, and create Role which will allow the application-team-1 ServiceAccount to authenticate and impersonate it.

```
make configure-vault
```

- Store the Venafi TPP credentials in a secret in Hashicorp Vault and create an access policy to allow these to be read by the Role that was created in the previous step.

```
make configure-vault-policy

```
```
make mount-tpp-secret

```
- Create a ServiceAccount which venafi-enhanced-issuer will use to authenticate to Hashicorp Vault.

```
make create-service-account-for-vault

```

- Create Roles and Role Bindings that will allow the venafi enhanced issuer service accounts to read the secrets that will be created to store the Venafi TPP access token and the secret that stores the username and password for Venafi.

```
make create-rbac-for-issuers
```

- Create VenafiIssuer and VenafiClusterIssuer

```
make create-vtpp-venafi-issuer-with-vault
```
- Create a CertificateRequest policy along with the Role and Rolebindings refrencing the VenafiClusterIssuer and the VenafiIssuer

```
make create-cert-policy-vault
```

- Create a Sample certificates using both the VenafiClusterIssuer and the VenafiIssuer

```
make create-sample-certs-vault
```
