# cert-manager Venafi Trust Protection Platform or Venafi As A Service to manage certificates in cluster. 
Use Venafi Trust Protection Platform or Venafi As A Service for signing all certificate requests


## Installing the cert-manager Venafi Enhanced Issuer

**IMPORTANT NOTE**
> Before installing cert-manager Venafi Enhanced Issuer, review the Helm chart located [here](../venafi-enhanced-issuer/pca/templates/values.yaml). 
More information about Venafi Enhanced Issuer can be found [here](https://platform.jetstack.io/documentation/installation/venafi-enhanced-issuer)


From the top level directory run the following 
```
make install-js-venafi-enhanced-issuer-module
```
This will install `js-venafi-enhanced-issuer-controller-manager` that request certificates signed using the Venafi Trust Protection Platform. 


Run the following to validate that the addtional module is installed.
```
kubectl get pods -n jetstack-secure
```
The `pca-aws-privateca-issuer-c8c8858c7-nxs2j` pod should be installed and it's the state should be `Ready=1/1`

## Creating a Venafi Enhanced Issuer using an credentials stored in a secret. 

There are several mechanisms to configure the venafi enhanced issuer. In this section we will go through creating a VenafiIssuer with an access token stored in a secret as
well as create a VenafiClusterIssuer with username and password for the TPP API user stored in a secret.

Change to the `venafi-enhanced-issuer` directory
```
cd venafi-enhanced-issuer
```

Create a secret with the access-token and create a VenafiIssuer to reference the access-token in the secret, also create a secret with the username and password for the TPP API user 
and create a VenafiClusterIssuer that refrences the username and password.

```
make create-venafi-issuers
```

The venafi issuers will not be ready. The problem is that venafi-enhanced-issuer is trying to request a ServiceAccount token but it doesn't have permission. So first let's add a Role and RoleBinding to venafi-cluster-issuer.yaml.

```
kubectl get venafiissuer -A
