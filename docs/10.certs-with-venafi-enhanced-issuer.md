# cert-manager Venafi Trust Protection Platform or Venafi As A Service to manage certificates in cluster. 
Use Venafi Trust Protection Platform or Venafi As A Service for signing all certificate requests


## Installing the cert-manager Venafi Enhanced Issuer

**IMPORTANT NOTE**
> Before installing cert-manager Venafi Enhanced Issuer, review the Helm chart located [here](../venafi-enhanced-issuer/pca/templates/values.yaml). 
More information about Venafi Enhanced Issuer can be found [here](https://platform.jetstack.io/documentation/installation/venafi-enhanced-issuer)


From the top level directory run the following 
```
make init

make install-js-venafi-enhanced-issuer-module
```
This will install `js-venafi-enhanced-issuer-controller-manager` that request certificates signed using the Venafi Trust Protection Platform. 


Run the following to validate that the addtional module is installed.
```
kubectl get pods -n jetstack-secure

## Creating a Venafi Enhanced Issuer using credentials stored in a secret. 

There are several mechanisms to configure the venafi enhanced issuer. In this section we will go through creating a VenafiIssuer with an access token stored in a secret as
well as create a VenafiClusterIssuer with username and password for the TPP API user stored in a secret.

- Change to the `venafi-enhanced-issuer` directory
```
cd venafi-enhanced-issuer
```

- Create Roles and Role Bindings that will allow the venafi enhanced issuer service accounts to read the secrets that will be created to store the Venafi TPP access token and the secret that stores the username and password for Venafi.

```
make create-rbac-for-issuers
```

- Create a secret with the access-token and create a VenafiIssuer to reference the access-token in the secret, also create a secret with the username and password for the TPP API user 
and create a VenafiClusterIssuer that refrences the username and password.

```
make create-venafi-issuers
```

The issuers should be in a checked and ready state

```
kubectl get VenafiIssuer -n sandbox      
➜  venafi-enhanced-issuer git:(riaz-example-features-3) ✗ kubectl get VenafiIssuer -n sandbox      
NAME                   READY   REASON    MESSAGE   LASTTRANSITION   OBSERVEDGENERATION   GENERATION   AGE
vtpp-enhanced-issuer   True    Checked   checked   4s               1                    1            5s
➜  venafi-enhanced-issuer git:(riaz-example-features-3) ✗ kubectl get VenafiClusterIssuer          
NAME                          READY   REASON    MESSAGE   LASTTRANSITION   OBSERVEDGENERATION   GENERATION   AGE
vtpp-enhanced-clusterissuer   True    Checked   checked   11s              1                    1            12s
```

- Create a CertificateRequest policy along with the Role and Rolebindings refrencing the VenafiClusterIssuer and the VenafiIssuer

```
make create-cert-policy 
```

- Create a Sample certificates using both the VenafiClusterIssuer and the VenafiIssuer

```
make create-sample-certs
```
