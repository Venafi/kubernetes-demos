# Configuring and running Venafi Firefly 

## Requirements  
- You are licensed to use Venafi TLS Protect for Kubernetes and have the credentials to pull enterprise cert-manager images from Venafi's private registry
- You have access to Venafi TLS Protect Cloud and the **Firefly** addon to create intermediate CA's along with policies to govern them. 

## Assumptions 
- For the purposes of this demo, **Firefly** will be configured to run in Kubernetes along with the rest of the workloads. In production environments it is recommended to isolate **Firefly** by running it in a dedicated nodepool or outside of the cluster in it's own VM or physical machine. When running outside the cluster Firefly will authenticate using `kubeconfig` associated with the `ServiceAccount` tied to a Firefly `Deployment`
- `CertificateRequest` resources will comply to the policies associated with Firefly configured in Venafi Control Plane. Most enterprises also run Venafi policies in-cluster with Venafi TLSPK Enterprise Policy Approver. If `policy-approver` is deployed in cluster, a `CertificateRequestPolicy` must be created that allows all for the **Firefly** issuer to avoid conflicting policies.
