# Setting up Venafi Trust Protection Platform for signing Istio service mesh workloads

All instructions for this setup will be done from the `istio` directory.
Change to `service-mesh/istio` from the top level by running

```
cd service-mesh/istio
```
## Preparing the cluster with the required secrets

The `settings.sh` is where all the environment is defined. 

Since configuring and validating the istio agent to use Jetstack cert-manager to sign all workloads involves multiple steps, the [Makefile](../service-mesh/istio/Makefile) has targets that are defined by the issuer and the step number. 

For example all targets that are executed will look like `vtpp-step<number>`

To setup the enviroment, run
```
make init
```
This will create the necessary temporary folders `artifacts\*` and a couple of new namespaces `istio-system` and `mesh-apps` 
`istio-system` is where Istio will be installed. This is also the namepace where all the `CertificateRequest` resources will be created for the workloads. 

**NOTE** The `mesh-apps` namespace has a specific label `istio-injection=enabled`. When we install the sample app in the end you will notice the `Envoy` proxy automatically injected into the deployed `pods`

## Step 1

In this first step we will configure the Helm chart required for installing the Jetstack cert-manager-istio-csr 
Review the [template](../service-mesh/istio/templates/values.yaml) 
Run 
```
make vtpp-step1
```
This will generate the istio-csr Helm chart at `artifacts/istio-csr/values.yaml`

## Step 2

In this step we will be creating several resources. 
- A Venafi issuer mapped to a policy folder (zone) that has the ability to issue an intermediate certificate 
- `CertificateRequestPolicy` that allows `CertificateRequests` to be approved from the above issuer. In addtion several other policies are created that will allow `CertificateRequests` to be approved. 
- A certificate with `isCA=true` that essentitally becomes your signing certificate 
- A CA issuer that will be used by istio

Review the files 
- [Certificate Policies and RBAC](../service-mesh/istio/common/cert-policy-and-rbac.yaml)
- [Venafi Issuer for ICA](../service-mesh/istio/templates/vtpp/ica-issuer.yaml)
- [Intermediate certificate and CA Issuer](../service-mesh/istio/templates/vtpp/intermediate-cert.yaml)

Run 
```
make vtpp-step2
```
The output of step2 will show all the resources created 
```
secret/tpp-auth-secret created
issuer.cert-manager.io/vtpp-intermediate-issuer created
certificate.cert-manager.io/jetstack-istio-ca.istio-system.svc.cluster.local created
issuer.cert-manager.io/jetstack-istio-ca created
configmap/venafi-tpp-ca-bundle configured
secret/access-token configured
certificaterequestpolicy.policy.cert-manager.io/cert-policy-for-istio-public-certs created
certificaterequestpolicy.policy.cert-manager.io/cert-policy-for-istio-intermediate-certs created
certificaterequestpolicy.policy.cert-manager.io/cert-policy-for-istio-signing-certificates created
certificaterequestpolicy.policy.cert-manager.io/cert-policy-for-istio-workload-certs created
clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/cert-manager-policy:cert-policy-for-istio-service-mesh-certs created
clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/cert-manager-policy:cert-policy-for-istio-service-mesh-certs created
```

All certificate resources are created in the `istio-system` namespace.  Please verify that the status of all the `CertificateRequestPolicies` are `Ready=True`

Run `kubectl get crp` to see 
```
NAME                                              READY   AGE
cert-policy-for-istio-intermediate-certs          True    62s
cert-policy-for-istio-public-certs                True    63s
cert-policy-for-istio-signing-certificates        True    62s
cert-policy-for-istio-workload-certs              True    62s
```

Run `kubectl get Issuer -n istio-system` to see 
```
NAMESPACE         NAME                                       READY   AGE
istio-system      jetstack-istio-ca                          True    74s
istio-system      vtpp-intermediate-issuer                   True    75s
```

Run `kubectl get Certificate -n istio-system` to see 
```
NAMESPACE         NAME                                                          READY   SECRET                                                        AGE
istio-system      jetstack-istio-ca.istio-system.svc.cluster.local              True    jetstack-istio-ca.istio-system.svc.cluster.local              82s
```

## Step 3
To keep it secure we will set the root-ca to be used for all the worklods. While the root CA can be automatically discovered, here's some [info](https://cert-manager.io/docs/tutorials/istio-csr/istio-csr/#export-the-root-ca-to-a-local-file) about why it's best to configure it as a secret that will be mounted in a volume. 

The location of the PEM file that contains the CA is set in the variable `JS_VENAFI_INTERMEDIATE_CA_ROOT_PEM_FILE` This is the same root that's part of 
`jetstack-istio-ca.istio-system.svc.cluster.local` 

We will now also install Jetstack cert-manager istio-csr in the `jetstack-secure` namespace. We have all the necessary details required for installing the module. 
Run
```
make vtpp-step3
```

```

cert-sync-to-venafi-cert-discovery-venafi-5c5c5865c5-wjhs7   2/2     Running   0          30m
```

The `cert-manager-istio-csr` pod should be up and `Running` with `Ready=1/1`

Refresh your Jetstack Secure dashboard to see all the certificate details.

## Step 4
In this step we will install Istio. Istio will be installed in the `istio-system` namespace. Istio itself will be installed using the `IstioOperator` located [here](../service-mesh/istio/templates/istio-operator.yaml) Review the `IstioOperator` to understand how Istio will be installed. Most importantly notice that `ENABLE_CA_SERVER` is set to `false` and all istio workloads request certificates from `istio-csr`

Additional details can be found [here](https://cert-manager.io/docs/tutorials/istio-csr/istio-csr/#installing-istio)

Run 
```
make vtpp-step4
```
You will see the following output on the console 

```
Installing Istio 1.14.1
✔ Istio core installed 
✔ Istiod installed  
✔ Egress gateways installed 
✔ Ingress gateways installed
✔ Installation complete
```

Running `kubectl get pods -n istio-system` will show you
```
NAME                                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
istio-egressgateway-794669f667-6tqjf    1/1     Running   0          23s
istio-ingressgateway-785854587f-m9hrn   1/1     Running   0          23s
istiod-c56f7554f-dm7qz                  1/1     Running   0          34s
```

Additionally, the `istio-ingressgateway` service of type `LoadBalancer` will be created. This will be a loadbalancer that will be automatically created in your Cloud Provider's enviroment. 

Run the following to check if the services are created correctly and that a `external-ip` has been assigned. For all hosts that will be defined in the `Gateway` the DNS will be mapped to this `external-ip`.

```
kubectl get svc -n istio-system
```
You will see the following output 
```
NAME                   TYPE           CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                                                                      AGE
istio-egressgateway    ClusterIP      10.100.145.178   <none>        80/TCP,443/TCP                                                               1m7s
istio-ingressgateway   LoadBalancer   10.100.244.133   xx.xx.xx.xx   15021:31951/TCP,80:31576/TCP,443:30622/TCP,31400:32674/TCP,15443:31703/TCP   1m7s
istiod                 ClusterIP      10.100.236.204   <none>        15010/TCP,15012/TCP,443/TCP,15014/TCP                                        1m18s
```
**NOTE** The actual IP has been replaced with xx.xx.xx.xx above. 

## STEP 5
As we want to make sure every workload communicates to other workload using mTLS we want to define a Istio ServiceMesh policy that absolutely mandates that mTLS is required. This is accomplished by creating a `PeerAuthentication` resource that is applied globally. You can choose to apply it to specific namespace via selectors if needed.
Review the `PeerAuthentication` resource [here](../service-mesh/istio/common/peerauthentication.yaml)

Run 
```
make vtpp-step5
```
Run the following 
```
kubectl get PeerAuthentication -n istio-system
```
and you will see 
```
NAME     MODE     AGE
global   STRICT   33s
```

## STEP 6
While we have setup everything we need to secure the workloads that are part of the mesh, we also need to secure the `Gateway` resources. The `Gateway` is the entrypoint into the cluster via a configured DNS and as such if accessed from a browser will require a publicly trusted certificate. 

In this step we will create another Venafi issuer and request a `Certificate`. Only this time, the policy folder (zone) that we will use will have the ability to issue a publicly trusted `Certificate` 

Review the following files 
- [Venafi Public Certificate Issuer](../service-mesh/istio/templates/vtpp/public-cert-issuer.yaml)
- [Public Certificate for Gateway](../service-mesh/istio/templates/vtpp/public-cert.yaml)

Run the following to create another issuer and a certificate. We have already created the `CertificateRequestPolicy` for making sure that this `CertificateRequest` is approved. 

```
make vtpp-step6
```
You will see the following output 

```
secret/tpp-auth-secret configured
issuer.cert-manager.io/vtpp-public-issuer created
certificate.cert-manager.io/storefront-vtpp.example.com created
```
The `Certificate` issued will also be available in the Venafi platform for you to review. 

Refresh your Jetstack Secure dashboard to see all the certificate details.

## STEP 7
This step will be different depending on how your `istio-ingressgateway` `external-ip` looks like and if you have the ability to add a A record or create a CNAME for the `commonName` that was used in the `Certificate`. For e.g if the domain that the `Certificate` was issued is `storefront-vtpp.example.com` (replace example.com with domain you have access to) then we need to create DNS records. 
Very likely you will have to take care of this step manually unless you are running your cluster in Google Cloud and have configured `settings.sh` all the information and have the ability to use `gcloud` 
In case of AWS you will create a CNAME to map to the ALB created for istio-ingressgateway
In case of GCP you will create a A record. 
If you are operating in Google Cloud running `make vtpp-step7` will create a A record mapping `storefront-vtpp.example.com` to `xx.xx.xx.xx` (The IP Addresss of istio-ingressgateway load balancer)
Irrespective of the approach you take, make sure that when you run `nslookup storefront-vtpp.example.com` you see the IP address of the `istio-ingressgateway` 


## STEP 8
This is an optional step. In this step we will deploy a sample app into the `mesh-apps` namespace. If you have your own app that you want to try with you can. 
The sample application that we will deploy is located [here](https://github.com/sitaramkm/microservices-demo)
The release manifest for the sample app is [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sitaramkm/microservices-demo/master/release/kubernetes-manifests.yaml)

Additonally, review the gateway resources that will created. The file is [here](../service-mesh/istio/templates/istio-manifests.yaml) 

The host name (for e.g storefront-vtpp.example.com) is what will be used as host in the Gateway. The public `Certificate` resource that we created has the secret also set as the host name to keep it simple. 

Run 
```
make vtpp-step8
```
Keep watching the pods in the `mesh-apps` namespace. After about a minute or so you will see the following when you run
```
kubectl get pods -n mesh-apps
```

```
NAME                                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

shippingservice-cddd85677-bsb76          2/2     Running   0          1m5s
```
**NOTE** All pods are `Ready=2/2` as we have enabled istio-injection on this namespace. Also, take a look at the `Gateway` by running 
```
kubectl get Gateway -n mesh-apps
``` 
and `VirtualService` by running 
```
kubectl get VirtualService -n mesh-apps
``` 

Access the application by going to https://storefront-vtpp.example.com . Replace `example.com` with your own domain.

Refresh the Jetstack Secure dashboard to look at the various SPIFFE SVIDS issued to all the workloads. Review the CA issued, it's validity. All certs are issued for 1 hour and are automatically renewed. 

Additionally, run 
```
make validate-secret --just-print
``` 
You will see the following output 
```
echo "Pod name is $(kubectl get pods -n mesh-apps -o jsonpath='{.items..metadata.name}' --selector app=frontend ) "
istioctl -n mesh-apps proxy-config secret $(kubectl get pods -n mesh-apps -o jsonpath='{.items..metadata.name}' --selector app=frontend )  \
	-o json | \
	jq -r '.dynamicActiveSecrets[0].secret.tlsCertificate.certificateChain.inlineBytes' | \
	base64 --decode | \
	openssl x509 -text -noout
```

If you want to inspect the secret dynamically injected into Istio's proxy config just run 
`make validate-secret` and you should see the x509 SPIFFE SVID associated with the `frontend` workload. 

## STEP 9
Really optional. Running `make vtpp-step9` will install Kiali, Prometheus, Grafana and Jaeger in your `istio-system` namespace.
