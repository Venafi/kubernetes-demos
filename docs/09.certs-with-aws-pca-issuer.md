# cert-manager AWS PCA issuer to manage certificates in cluster. 
Use AWS ACM Private Certificate Authority for signing all certificate requests


## Installing the cert-manager AWS PCA issuer

**IMPORTANT NOTE**
> Before installing cert-manager AWS PCA issuer, review the Helm chart located [here](../external-issuers/pca/templates/values.yaml). 
AWS PCA issuer is regarded as an external issuer. More information about external issuers can be found [here](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/external/)


From the top level directory run the following 
```
make install-pca-issuer-in-cluster
```
This will install `pca-issuer` that request certificates signed using an AWS KMS asymmetric key. 


Run the following to validate that the addtional module is installed.
```
kubectl get pods -n jetstack-secure
```
The `pca-aws-privateca-issuer-c8c8858c7-nxs2j` pod should be installed and it's the state should be `Ready=1/1`

## Creating a secret to access AWS account. 

There are several mechanisms to make the cluster access the AWS PCA Service as documented [here](https://github.com/cert-manager/aws-privateca-issuer#supported-workflows)
We will use Kubernetes secrets to store access to AWS>

Change to the `external-issuers` directory
```
cd external-issuers
```

Review the `Secret` resource located [here](../external-issuers/pca/templates/aws-secret.yaml)
The configuration is pretty straight forward and creates a new `Secret` resource that holds the credentials to AWS. The enviroment variables referenced here is configured in `settings.sh` 

Run
 ```
 make create-pca-secret
 ```

Validate that the `Secret` is created in the `sandbox` namespace. 
```
kubectl describe secret aws-pca-secret -n sandbox
```
and you will should see the following. Note the various AWS specific variables set to access PCA. The minimum policy required for the cert-manager PCA issuer is documented [here](https://github.com/cert-manager/aws-privateca-issuer#configuration)

```
Type:  Opaque

Data
====
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY:  40 bytes
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID:      20 bytes
AWS_REGION:             9 bytes

```

## Creating a AWS PCA Issuer

Review the [PCA Issuer](../external-issuers/pca/templates/aws-pca-issuer.yaml) 

The AWS PCA issuer requires the ARN of the PCA along with the reference to the secret that allows access to the referenced PCA

Run
```
make create-pca-issuer
```

This will create a `AWSPCAIssuer` in the `sandbox` namespace. 

Run the following to describe the KMS Issuer and it's status
```
kubectl describe AWSPCAIssuer -n sandbox
```

You will see the following. 

```
Status:
  Conditions:
    Last Transition Time:  2022-09-20T23:19:01Z
    Message:               Issuer verified
    Reason:                Verified
    Status:                True
    Type:                  Ready
Events:
  Type    Reason    Age                From                     Message

  Normal  Verified  11s (x2 over 11s)  awspcaissuer-controller  Issuer verified
```

## Creating policy and RBAC for approving the certificate requests

Review the following files 
- [Certificate Policy RBAC](../external-issuers/pca/config/cert-policy-rbac.yaml)
- [Certificate Policy](../external-issuers/pca/config/cert-policy.yaml)

Notice the `selector` in the policy. Specifically the `kind` and `group`. It is set to match the KMS issuer `group` and `kind`. Addtionally the policy approver has been updated to include PCA signer [here](../certificate-approver/approver-policy/values.yaml) The approver policy has to be reinstalled to include the addtional signer.   

Run the following to create the policy and RBAC
```
make create-pca-policy-and-rbac
```

## Creating certs for validation

Simply run the following 
```
make create-certs
```

This will create two `Certificate` resources in the `sandbox` namespace. Run the following

```
kubectl get Certificate -n sandbox
```
And you will see the following 

```
NAME                                 READY   SECRET                               AGE
cert1-pca-issuer.svc.cluster.local   True    cert1-pca-issuer.svc.cluster.local   3m
cert2-pca-issuer.svc.cluster.local   False   cert2-pca-issuer.svc.cluster.local   3m
```

Look at the accompanying `CertificateRequests` by running 

```
kubectl get CertificateRequests -n sandbox
```
You will see the following 

```
NAME                                       APPROVED   DENIED   READY   ISSUER          REQUESTOR                                            AGE
cert1-pca-issuer.svc.cluster.local-wsbvx   True                True    awspca-issuer   system:serviceaccount:jetstack-secure:cert-manager   26s
cert2-pca-issuer.svc.cluster.local-r28g4              True     False   awspca-issuer   system:serviceaccount:jetstack-secure:cert-manager   26s
```

One of them will be `Approved` and the other `Denied`. Review the `Certificate` resource and the associated policy to understand why one of them was `Denied`

Describe the `CertificateRequest` that was `Denied` and you will see

```
Events:
  Type     Reason  Age   From                     Message
  ----     ------  ----  ----                     -------
  Warning  Denied  60s   policy.cert-manager.io   No policy approved this request: [pca-issuer-policy-for-ns-sandbox: spec.allowed.uris.required: Required value: true]
  Warning  Denied  60s   awspcaissuer-controller  The CertificateRequest was denied by an approval controller
