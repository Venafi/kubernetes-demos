# Creating a Venafi Connection

The VenafiConnection custom resources are used to configure the connection and authentication between the Venafi Control Plane and your Kubernetes cluster.

The simplest way of authentication to the Venafi control plane is using the Venafi TPP access-token, Venafi-TPP username and password or Venafi-as-a-Service API Key stored as a Kubernetes secrert. The Venafi connection supports secretless authentication using JWT or storing credentails in an external secrets engine like Vault. In this sample we will use the username and password authentication. 

We will use a simple form of authentication using a Venafi-TPP username and password

- Change to the `common` directory from the top level
```
cd common
```  
- Run initialize to create the temporary folders
```
make init
```
- Create the venafi credentials secret
    A `Secret` that holds the *access_token* , tpp username and tpp password , tls protect cloud api key to authenticate against Venafi 
```
make create-venafi-credentials
```
- Create the necessary RBAC that gives the 'venafi-connection' ServiceAccount the permission to read the secret created in the above step
```
make create-venafi-connection-rbac
```
- Create the venafi connection resource, this will create a connection in the jetstack-secure namespace (used by VenafiClusterIssuers), Connections can also be created in namespaces for (VenafiIssuers)
```
make create-venafi-tpp-connection
```
- Check if the connection is created
```
kubectl get VenafiConnection -n jetstack-secure
NAME              AGE
vtpp-connection   59s
```
