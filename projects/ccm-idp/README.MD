# Certificate Manager for issuing certificates with service accounts mapped to IDP. 

This demo is to demonstrate requesting certificates using Certificate Manager without using an APIKey. The demo uses Okta, Azure and Auth0 but can be configured to use any OIDC provider.  

## Pre-requisites
- You have access to CyberArk Certificate Manager
- Certificate Authorities and Issuing Templates are created in Certificate Manager along with an Application
- You have followed the instructions provided [here](https://docs.venafi.cloud/vcs-platform/serviceaccounts/t-service-accounts-create-API-integration/) to create a custom API integration for your IDP. 

## Running the demo 

### Environment variables
Copy `env-vars-template.sh` as `env-vars.sh` and set the required variables

### Test

Run `./issue-cert.sh` and you will see
```
Usage: ./issue-cert.sh [okta|azure|auth0]
```

Run `./issue-cert.sh okta` and you will see 

```
